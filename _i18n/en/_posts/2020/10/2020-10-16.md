Steps to create a new sudo user in ubuntu 18.04

1. Using ssh, log in to your server as the root user  

```bash
ssh root@server_ip_address

```

Use the adduser command to add a new user

- Be sure to replace username with the user which you want to create

```bash
adduser **username**

```

Set the user's password

- A strong password is highly recommended!

```bash
Set password prompts:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully

```

Set the user's information

```bash
User information prompts:
Changing the user information for username
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
    Full Name []:
    Room Number []:
    Work Phone []:
    Home Phone []:
    Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]

```

Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group

```bash
usermod -aG sudo username

```

Use the su command to switch to the new user account

```bash
su - username
sudo command_to_run

```

Test the new user account

For example, you can list the contents of the /root directory, which is only accessible to the root user

```bash
sudo ls -la /root

```
